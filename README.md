## 🗺️ How to Navigate

1. **Not sure where to start?** If you've never worked with AI before, head to the [Beginner](./beginner/) section. If you're comfortable with programming or have studied AI concepts before, the [Advanced](./advanced/) section is for you.

2. **Looking for something specific?** Use the links above to jump directly to a section, or browse the `docs/` folder within each section for individual topics.

3. **Want to go further?** Many learners start in the Beginner section and progress to the Advanced section over time. There's no rush — work at your own pace!
